<p>Effective Date: December 2024</p>

<p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app (the "App") to migrate your Fitbit activities into Strava. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring that your data is handled responsibly.
</p>
<h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>

<h4>1.1 Fitbit Data</h4>

<p>To facilitate the migration of your activities, the App collects the following information from your Fitbit account:</p>

<p>Activity data (e.g., steps, distance, heart rate, calories burned, workout sessions, etc.).</p>

<h4>1.2 Strava Data</h4>

<p>
    To complete the migration, we require authorization to access your Strava account. We only use this access to upload the activity data you have chosen to migrate.
</p>
<h4>1.3 Authentication Tokens</h4>

<p>
    We use OAuth tokens from Fitbit and Strava to authenticate and authorize data migration.
</p>
<p>
    These tokens are temporary and are not stored once the migration process is completed.
</p>
<p>
    We do not collect or store any personal health data beyond what is required for migration.
</p>
<h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>

<p>
    The information we collect is used exclusively for the purpose of migrating your Fitbit activities into Strava. Specifically:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Authenticate your Fitbit and Strava accounts.</li>

    <li>Retrieve activities from your Fitbit account.</li>

    <li>Upload those activities to your Strava account.</li>
</ul>


<p>We do not:</p>

<ul>
    <li> Use your health information for any other purpose.</li>

    <li> Sell or share your data with third parties.</li>

    <li>Store or analyze your activity data for any secondary use.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Data Retention</h3>

<p>
    We only store the Fitbit excercise and used ID in order to track which excercises where migrated because FitBit does not provide any other cross reference ID that can be used to retrieve that information. We do not store your data beyond the duration of the migration process. Once the transfer is complete:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Any temporary data retrieved for migration (e.g., activity details) is deleted.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>4. How We Protect Your Information</h3>

<p>
    We take the security of your data seriously and implement industry-standard measures to protect your information during the migration process:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        All communications between the App and Fitbit/Strava APIs are encrypted using HTTPS.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    No personal or health data is stored on our servers.
</p>
<h3>5. Third-Party Services</h3>

<p>
    The App relies on the Fitbit and Strava APIs to perform the migration. By using the App, you agree to their respective privacy policies:

    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.strava.com/legal/privacy"> Strava Privacy Policy</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We do not have control over how these third-party services handle your data outside the context of this App.
</p>
<h3>6. Your Rights</h3>

    </li>
</ul>
